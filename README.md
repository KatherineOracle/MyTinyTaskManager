## Task description
Create a full-stack web app for maintenance management.

Your application should allow one to:
* Submit a job that needs doing, including its description, location, and priority.
    * Each job should have a status, being one of submitted, in progress, and completed.
    * List all jobs, ordered by status and date submitted.
    * Update information about a single job.
    * Update status of multiple jobs at once (batch update).
    * Archive a specific job (so that it is no longer shown on the list, but isnâ€™t totally deleted)
    * Filter jobs by status (such that only jobs of one status is shown at a time).
